# 🚀 Real-Time Face Emotion Detection using CNN

Welcome to the **Real-Time Face Emotion Detection** project! This repository implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to detect facial emotions in real time. It is designed to recognize emotions like happiness, sadness, anger, and surprise, among others. This project is ideal for applications in sentiment analysis, user experience enhancement, and more.

## 📂 Dataset

The model is trained on the [Facial Expression Recognition (FER-2013) dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/challenges-in-representation-learning-facial-expression-recognition-challenge/data?source=post_page-----f9239fdc63ad--------------------------------), a popular dataset for emotion detection tasks.

## 🌟 Features

- **Real-Time Emotion Detection**: Using your webcam (or video feed) to detect emotions instantly.
- **Convolutional Neural Network**: A custom CNN architecture optimized for emotion classification.
- **Pre-trained Model**: Load and use the model without needing to re-train (if using the included model file).
- **Image Augmentation**: Improve generalization with data augmentation techniques.

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- **Python** 🐍
- **TensorFlow/Keras** 🤖
- **OpenCV** 👓
- **NumPy & Pandas** 📊


## 📝 Model Architecture

The CNN model consists of:
1. **Convolutional Layers**: Extract features from input images.
2. **Pooling Layers**: Reduce spatial dimensions and help in feature generalization.
3. **Dropout Layers**: Prevent overfitting by randomly setting units to zero.
4. **Dense Layers**: Perform classification on the extracted features.
